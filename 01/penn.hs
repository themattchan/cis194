-- Parametrized types

-- for example (defined in Prelude, Data.Maybe):
-- data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

-- "We usually use type parameters when the type that's contained inside
-- the data type's various value constructors isn't really that important
-- for the type to work. A list of stuff is a list of stuff and it
-- doesn't matter what the type of that stuff is, it can still work. If
-- we want to sum a list of numbers, we can specify later in the summing
-- function that we specifically want a list of numbers. Same goes for
-- Maybe. Maybe represents an option of either having nothing or having
-- one of something. It doesn't matter what the type of that something
-- is." - http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses
